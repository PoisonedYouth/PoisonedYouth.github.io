Hello, I'm *Matthias* and an enthusiastic software craftsman
experienced in *Java* and *Kotlin*. My main focus are the *Spring* and *Ktor* ecosystem.

*PoisonedYouth* is my nickname I used since I started with online games long time ago and
because it has been part of my life for so long, my personal blog will also take it as part
of the name.

'''

My personal interests as software developer are:

- Ktor

- Exposed

- Koin

- Konsist

- http4k

- SpringBoot

- Kotest

- Arrow

'''

Beside developing software I'm a technical reviewer of
several books in the ecosystem of Kotlin.
