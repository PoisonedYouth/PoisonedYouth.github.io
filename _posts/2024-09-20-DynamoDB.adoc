After working mostly with relation databases in my career, in the past nearly 8 months I started heavily using *DynamoDB* in one of my projects that run on production. Starting with *DynamoDB* was very easy but in order to profit from it advantages it is necessary to learn some different concepts comparing to relation databases.
In this post, I explore the basics of *DynamoDB* and demonstrate how to integrate it in a Ktor application.
I walk through setting up a *DynamoDB* connection, create a table and performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using AWS SDK. To write more idiomatic Kotlin code, I extend the usage of the AWS SDK by an additional library.

This post only covers the absolut basics to start with *DynamoDB*. The things you will learn will be the foundation to start with more advanced topics like modeling the tables (also using composite keys), using converters for custom data types, creating GSI (Global Secondary Index) for querying large amount of data in a performant way and using batch processing for fast reading/writing data.

Before diving into code let's first answer the question of what DynamoDB is.

== What is DynamoDB?

Amazon *DynamoDB* is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS that offers fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It stores data in key-value and document formats, making it ideal for handling large amounts of structured or semi-structured data. *DynamoDB* automatically manages data replication, backups, and recovery across multiple AWS regions, providing high availability and fault tolerance.

== Why using DynamoDB?

There are a lot of benefits for using a *DynamoDB* database.

- *Fully Managed and Scalable*:
No server management, AWS handles all infrastructure tasks. Automatic scaling adjusts capacity based on demand.

- *Flexible Data Model*
NoSQL database with key-value and document data models. Query data via primary keys or secondary indexes.

- *Backup, Restore, and TTL*
On-demand backups, point-in-time recovery, and automatic expiration with Time-to-Live (TTL).

- *High Performance and Low Latency*
Single-digit millisecond response times. Horizontally scales to maintain performance at any scale.

- *ACID Transactions*
Supports atomic multi-item transactions ensuring data consistency.

To see how DynamoDB can be used, let's have a look on how it can be integrated.

== Prerequisites

To start with *DynamoDB* there are 3 things necessary:

1. A running DynamoDB database to access.
2. A Ktor application that wants to access the database for writing and reading data.
3. The AWS SDK to connect to the database.

This is the time for diving into code...

=== DynamoDB

In production *DynamoDB* is used as an AWS service, but to not make it necessary to create an AWS account and to spend money for using AWS services, I decide to use a locally running *DynamoDB* database.

In the official *DynamoDB* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html[documentation] of AWS you can find multiple options for running DynamoDB as a local service. For this article I choose the Docker variant and create a _docker-compose.yml_ file that contains the configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.8'
services:
  dynamodb-local:
    command: "-jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath ./data"
    image: "amazon/dynamodb-local:latest"
    container_name: dynamodb-local
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "./docker/dynamodb:/home/dynamodblocal/data"
    working_dir: /home/dynamodblocal
----

Before proceeding, I check if the access to the *DynamoDB* local instance is possible. For this I can use the AWS CLI. If you don't have it already installed, you can find the instructions in the official https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[documentation].

First start the local *DynamoDB*:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up
----

Then check for available tables in the database:

[source,shell]
----
aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
----
The parameter _endpoint-url_ is important so that it is not tried to access AWS remotely.

The command should print out

[source,shell]
----
{
    "TableNames": []
}
----

because I have not created a table yet, but the connection is successful. That is enough for now.

=== Ktor

The next step is to set up the Ktor application, which can be done by using the https://start.ktor.io/settings[Ktor starter] or the project wizard in IntelliJ.

The resulting __build.gradle.kts__ file should look like below:

[source,kotlin]
----
val kotlin_version: String by project
val logback_version: String by project

plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "2.0.20"
    id("io.ktor.plugin") version "3.0.0-rc-1"
    kotlin("plugin.serialization") version "2.0.20"
}

group = "com.poisonedyouth"
version = "0.0.1"

application {
    mainClass.set("com.poisonedyouth.ApplicationKt")

    val isDevelopment: Boolean = project.ext.has("development")
    applicationDefaultJvmArgs = listOf("-Dio.ktor.development=$isDevelopment")
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io" )}
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.ktor:ktor-server-core-jvm")
    implementation("io.ktor:ktor-server-cio-jvm")
    implementation("ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:$logback_version")

    implementation("io.ktor:ktor-server-content-negotiation")
    implementation("io.ktor:ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json")

    testImplementation("io.ktor:ktor-server-test-host-jvm")
    testImplementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test-junit:$kotlin_version")
}
----
There is nothing special. I choose the _CIO_ server engine and _kotlinx.serialization_ for the handling of the serialization and deserialization from and to JSON. This is necessary for the HTTP endpoints that I use for testing the usage of the *DynamoDB*.

=== AWS SDK

The last step of the prerequisites is the connection of the Ktor application with the running local *DynamoDB* database.
For this it is necessary to include additional entries to the dependencies section:

[source,kotlin]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:dynamodb-enhanced:2.28.1")
    implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:dynamodb:2.28.1")
    implementation("com.github.oharaandrew314:dynamodb-kotlin-module:0.8.1")
}
----

The first two are provided by AWS to set up a client for the connection and the third one is an extension to be able to communicate with *DynamoDB* in a more Kotlin idiomatic way by allowing to use data classes with immutable properties.

== Implementation

Now that the prerequisites are finished I can start with the implementation of the sample application, that I use to demonstrate the usage of the *DynamoDB* together with Ktor.

=== Step 1: Define the Domain Model

I define a simple Kotlin data class to represent the product model. The properties of the `Product` are modelled as value classes to include some validation logic.

[source,kotlin]
----
@Serializable
data class Product(
    val productId: ProductId,
    val productName: ProductName,
    val price: Price
)

@JvmInline
@Serializable
value class ProductId(val value: String){
    init {
        require(value.isNotBlank()) { "Product Id cannot be blank" }
        require(value.length == 16) { "Product Id must be 16 characters" }
    }
}

@JvmInline
@Serializable
value class ProductName(val value: String){
    init {
        require(value.isNotBlank()) { "Product Name cannot be blank" }
        require(value.length <= 32) { "Product Name cannot be longer than 32 characters" }
    }
}

@JvmInline
@Serializable
value class Price(val value: Double) {
    init {
        require(value >= 0.0) { "Price must be positive." }
    }
}
----

To separate the persistence from the domain model I create a separate data class that represents an entry in the *DynamoDb* table using data types that are supported.

[source,kotlin]
----
@DynamoDbBean
data class ProductEntity(
    @DynamoKtPartitionKey
    val productId: String,
    val productName: String,
    val price: Double
)
----

There are 2 annotations necessary for using this class as an entity.

- `@DynamoDbBean`:
This identifies this class as being a *DynamoDB* mappable entity.
- `@DynamoKtPartitionKey`: This identifies the partition key of the table. This is necessary for every *DynamoDB* table. It is also possible to provide a composite key but that is out of scope of this post.

=== Step 2: Create the DynamoDB Client

For the connection to the database I create a low-level client instance.
This instance provides basic functionality like creation of tables and operations for adding, updating, deleting and retrieving data. There are 2 client variants available:

- `DynamoDbClient`
- `DynamoDbAsyncClient`

The first one is a synchronous variant that blocks until the request is finished, the second one is an asynchronous version that is perfectly working together with Coroutines. Because I used the Ktor CIO engine for this example application I create a `DynamoDbAsyncClient`.

[source,kotlin]
----
fun Application.createDynamoDbClient(): DynamoDbAsyncClient {
    val url = environment.config.property("ktor.database.dynamodbUrl").getString()

    return DynamoDbAsyncClient.builder()
        .endpointOverride(URI(url)) // Local DynamoDB
        .build()
}
----

You may wonder where the credentials for the access to the database is configured. I use a local running *DynamoDB* that does not need any credentials. In a productive environment a credentials provider need to be configured that contains the credentials for accessing AWS.

[source, kotlin]
----
DynamoDbAsyncClient.builder()
    .credentialsProvider {
        TODO()
    }
    .endpointOverride(URI(url))
    .build()
----

Using the `DynamoDbClient` directly is very inconvenient and makes it necessary to write a lot of boilerplate code, so to reduce this, the AWS SDK also provides an enhanced variant of the client.

[source,kotlin]
----
fun createEnhancedDynamoDbClient(dynamoDbClient: DynamoDbAsyncClient): DynamoDbEnhancedAsyncClient {
    return DynamoDbEnhancedAsyncClient.builder()
        .dynamoDbClient(dynamoDbClient)
        .build()
}
----
The enhanced client wraps the `DynamoDbAsyncClient`.

=== Step 3: Creating a DynamoDB Table

Next, I need to create a table in the *DynamoDB* to store the products.I use the `createTable()` function for this. Because an exception is thrown if I try to create an already existing table again, I need to check first for all available tables.This is one of the API calls that is not available for the `DynamoDbEnhancedAsyncClient` so I need the low-level variant for this.

[source,kotlin]
----
suspend fun createNecessaryTables(dynamoDbClient: DynamoDbAsyncClient, dynamoDbEnhancedClient: DynamoDbEnhancedAsyncClient) {
    val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Application::class.java)

    val existingTables = dynamoDbClient.listTables().await().tableNames()

    val productEntity = ProductEntity::class
    val tableSchema = DataClassTableSchema(productEntity)
    if (existingTables.contains(productEntity.simpleName)) {
        logger.info("Table '${productEntity.simpleName}' already exists.")
    } else {
        dynamoDbEnhancedClient.table(productEntity.simpleName, tableSchema).createTable().await()
        logger.info("Table '${productEntity.simpleName}' created successfully.")
    }
}
----

The above code creates a table named _ProductEntity_ with `productId` as the partition key.

In a productive environment it is not recommended to create the tables by the application but use i.e. https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-dynamodb[Terraform] for this task.

=== Step 4: Implement CRUD operations for product entity

Now that I have a table, let's implement the operations to create, update, find and delete products.

Using the enhanced client makes this very convenient. I create a `DataClassTableSchema` using the `ProductEntity` type and can call the required CRUD operations on this instance. The calls with the client are asynchronous, so I need to call `await()` on every operation. This is an extension function that is provided by the _kotlinx.coroutines_ library.

[source,kotlin]
----
private val tableName = ProductEntity::class.simpleName
private val tableSchema = DataClassTableSchema(ProductEntity::class)

suspend fun add(product: Product): Unit = coroutineScope {
        table.putItem(product.toProductEntity()).await()
    }

    suspend fun findById(productId: String): Product? {
        return table.getItem(
            Key.builder().partitionValue(productId).build()
        ).await()?.toProduct()
    }

     suspend fun findAll(): List<Product> {
        return buildList {
            table.scan().subscribe { page ->
                page.items().stream().forEach { item -> add(item.toProduct()) }
            }.await()
        }
    }

    suspend fun deleteById(productId: String) {
        table.deleteItem(Key.builder().partitionValue(productId).build()).await()
    }

    suspend fun updateProduct(product: Product) {
        table.updateItem(product.toProductEntity()).await()
    }
----

That's it. This ist very simple and by wrapping the client in a repository class I can separate
the access to the *DynamoDB* database from the rest of the application code.

=== Step 5: Provide REST endpoints.

In the last step I need to provide some REST endpoints to test if the repository implementation is working as expected.

Below you can find the functionality for a POST endpoint that allows to create new products.

[source, kotlin]
----
class ProductService(
    private val productRepository: ProductRepository
) {

    suspend fun addProduct(product: Product) {
        val existingProduct = productRepository.findById(product.productId.value)
        if (existingProduct != null) {
            error("Product with id ${product.productId} already exists.")
        }
        productRepository.add(product)
    }
    //...
}
----


[source, kotlin]
----
fun Application.configureRouting(productService: ProductService) {
    routing {
         post("/product") {
            productService.addProduct(call.receive())
            call.respond(HttpStatusCode.Created)
        }
    //...
    }
}
----

To keep things simple I omit to introduce Koin for the dependency injection, but
manually inject the dependencies.

[source, kotlin]
----
fun Application.module() = runBlocking {
    val dynamoDbClient = createDynamoDbClient()
    val dynamoDbEnhancedClient = createEnhancedDynamoDbClient(dynamoDbClient)
    createNecessaryTables(dynamoDbClient, dynamoDbEnhancedClient)

    configureSerialization()

    val productRepository = ProductRepository(dynamoDbEnhancedClient)
    val productService = ProductService(productRepository)
    configureRouting(productService)
}
----

With this the application is complete and I can create some requests to check if everything works as expected. For this an IntelliJ scratch file is an easy way.

[source, text]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/product
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "productId" : "1111111111111111",
  "productName" : "Testproduct",
  "price": 2.32
}

###
POST http://localhost:8080/product
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId" : "1111111111111112",
  "productName" : "Testproduct2",
  "price": 5.12
}

###
GET http://localhost:8080/product/1111111111111111
Accept: application/json

###

GET http://localhost:8080/product
Accept: application/json

###
PUT localhost:8080/product
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId" : "1111111111111112",
  "productName" : "Testproduct",
  "price": 12.12
}

###
DELETE localhost:8080/product/1234
----

Executing the POST request returns the expected result:

[source, shell]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/product

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Length: 0

<Response body is empty>

Response code: 201 (Created); Time: 473ms (473 ms); Content length: 0 bytes (0 B)
----

That's it for today.

== Conclusion
Today I showed how easy *DynamoDB* can be used as persistence storage for Kotlin applications, using Ktor as an example. AWS provides an SDK that allows to connect to the database in either synchronous or asynchronous way. The available client provides all necessary functionality for the classical CRUD operations. Comparing to use a relational database using the classical JDBC connection the *DynamoDB* can be used in a similar way. The _dynamodb-kotlin-module_ makes it very convenient to use the AWS SDK, that is written in Java, in a Kotlin idiomatic way.

This post only covers the absolut surface of working with *DynamoDB*. As already mentioned at the beginning there are a lot of more advanced topics available, that are necessary to know when using the database in a productive environment.

In the next post I will continue with the following topics:

- Composite keys for tables.
- Using GSI (global secondary index).
- Use converters for custom data types.
- Use batch processing for read and write operations.
- Filter expressions and query conditionals.
- Using TTL.
